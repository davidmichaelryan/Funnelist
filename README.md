Approaches to metrics
================

Theoretically motivated approach:
- This is how i think the world works. lets make this system with my rules, see how it works, and maybe tweak it from there.
Statistically motivated approach:
- Have things you are interested. analyze how correlated your thoughts are with reality.
Data exploration:
- Not necessarily best thing. variation on how long it takes.
Weka (Machine Learning):
- Feature selection algorithm. need testing data set.
